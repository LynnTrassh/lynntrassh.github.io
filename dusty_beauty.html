              People tend to enjoy things that are mysterious. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For instance, Nona Lisa was famous for her uncertain smile, which makes people guess whether if she was really happy or not. This type mysterious, surreal beauty, 
              which allows viewers to expand their imagination, is alway emphasized in Chinese paintings, h-lowever, due to the stereotypical belief that oil-paintings are the only "serious type" of art, little attention is placed into the Chinese paintings. 
              <br>
              <br>
              My art looks like an abstract dreamcatcher, which is meant to be an entrance to a cave covered by a spider net; it also shows Chinese scenery painted in the background. Due to the incomprehension of this kind of art form, 
              <br>
              <br>
              Chinese paintings never truly get rid of the spider net; the spider net is a temporary veil to discover the beauty inside the cave. I also took a picture of myself carrying a bow and trying to shoot the dreamcatcher as a target. This shows my desire and ambition to promote Chinese traditional paintings.
